NAME
    PDF::FromHTML - Convert HTML documents to PDF

SYNOPSIS
        my $pdf = PDF::FromHTML->new( encoding => 'utf-8' );

        # Loading from a file:
        $pdf->load_file('source.html');

        # Or from a scalar reference:
        # $pdf->load_file(\$input);

        # Perform the actual conversion:
        $pdf->convert(
            # With PDF::API2, font names such as 'traditional' also works
            Font        => 'font.ttf',
            LineHeight  => 10,
            Landscape   => 1,
        );

        # Write to a file:
        $pdf->write_file('target.pdf');

        # Or to a scalar reference:
        # $pdf->write_file(\$output);

DESCRIPTION
    This module transforms HTML into PDF, using an assortment of XML
    transformations implemented in PDF::FromHTML::Twig.

    There is also a command-line utility, html2pdf.pl, that comes with this
    distribution.

PUBLIC METHODS
  convert(%params)
    Convert the loaded file to PDF. Valid parameters are:

        PageWidth         640
        PageResolution    540
        FontBold          'HelveticaBold'
        FontOblique       'HelveticaOblique'
        FontBoldOblique   'HelveticaBoldOblique'
        LineHeight        12
        FontUnicode       'Helvetica'
        Font              (same as FontUnicode)
        PageSize          'A4'
        Landscape         0

HINTS & TIPS
  <img> tags
    Add the height and width attributes if you are creating the source HTML,
    it keeps PDF::FromHTML from having to open and read the source image
    file to get the real size. Less file I/O means faster processing.

CAVEATS
    Although PDF::FromHTML will work with both HTML and XHTML formats, it is
    not designed to utilise CSS.

    This means any HTML using external or inline CSS for design and layout,
    including but not limited to: images, backgrounds, colours, fonts etc...
    will not be converted into the PDF.

    To get an idea of the likely resulting PDF, you may wish to use an
    non-CSS capable browser for testing first.

    There is currently no plan to adapt this module to utilise CSS. (Patches
    welcome, though!)
